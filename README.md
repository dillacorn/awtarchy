pronounced: **aw-tar-chee**

**awtarchy** is not a Linux distribution. It is an overlay environment for base Arch Linux.

## Install model

1. Install Arch with `archinstall` and select the Minimal profile, or install Arch manually.
2. Apply the awtarchy overlay on top of that base system.

For the current commands and install behavior, use the [Installation guide](INSTALL.md). Existing users should use the [Updating guide](UPDATING.md).

> **Development note:** Awtarchy is a personal passion project maintained in spare time. Large language models have been used as development tools to assist with writing, reviewing, refactoring, documentation, and troubleshooting parts of the project. I use that assistance to spend more of my limited project time testing changes on real systems, diagnosing failures, and validating releases. LLM-assisted changes are not assumed correct simply because they were generated; they are reviewed and tested as part of the normal development process.

## Why this approach

* Flexible: works over any clean Arch install.
* Lightweight: no separate ISO or custom repositories required.
* Low maintenance: relies on Arch’s installer and official repositories.
* Transparent: the local installer and maintenance scripts can be reviewed before use.

## Workflow expectations

awtarchy targets users who prefer TTY login, direct shell interaction, and manual control over their system. It assumes comfort with the command line and basic Arch Linux maintenance.

## Install and maintenance

- **Fresh installation:** [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
- **Stable updates, review/reset, version state, and Git-testing:** [UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md)
- **Published release notes:** [Releases](https://github.com/dillacorn/awtarchy/releases)

Run `awtarchy` with no arguments for the interactive maintenance menu after installation.

## AUR packages

Awtarchy uses upstream [aur-scanner](https://github.com/KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner) for AUR scanning and installation. `yay` remains available for read-only search and query commands such as `yay -Ss package`, `yay -Si package`, and `yay -Qm`; Awtarchy's interactive shell blocks package-changing `yay`/`paru` transactions.

Install an AUR package with:

```bash
aur-scan install package
```

Use `aur-scan -h` for the current scanner commands and options. Awtarchy does not duplicate the complete upstream command reference here so the upstream project remains authoritative.

## Failure reporting

Awtarchy can prepare a small sanitized report when it recognizes certain Awtarchy-owned Quickshell failures. Reports are **never submitted silently**. When an interactive terminal is available, Awtarchy offers to send the report, review it first, or not send it. Noninteractive failures can remain pending locally for later review.

Submitted reports contain only a strict allowlist of failure identifiers and broad software/hardware version context. They do not include usernames, hostnames, home-directory paths, raw logs, command history, clipboard contents, secrets, or a persistent machine/install identifier.

Accepted reports are sent through an Awtarchy Cloudflare Worker and may create a deduplicated public GitHub issue through the restricted Awtarchy Report Bot. Cloudflare necessarily processes network connection metadata to receive the request, so Awtarchy does not claim absolute network-layer anonymity.

See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the exact reporting and data-handling model.
