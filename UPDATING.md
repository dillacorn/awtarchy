# Updating Awtarchy

Use the installed `awtarchy` maintenance command for normal updates. Do not reclone the repository or rerun the full installer for routine upgrades.

## Update to the latest stable release

```bash
awtarchy update
```

Stable update/reset/review operations target published Awtarchy releases. The maintenance command/runtime itself can refresh from `main` independently so updater-only fixes do not require a new configuration release. Changes to release-managed configuration are available to normal stable updates only after a new published stable release includes them; editing release notes does not change the configuration payload users receive. Optional package choices remain separate.

## Review changes before applying them

```bash
awtarchy review
```

This previews release-managed configuration differences without applying the update.

Awtarchy intentionally distinguishes user-owned files/state from release-managed files. Normal updates preserve selected user configuration such as `hyprland.lua` according to the current updater policy and create backup files when managed local edits are overwritten.

## Reset managed configuration

```bash
awtarchy reset
```

Use reset when you intentionally want Awtarchy-managed configuration returned to the published release defaults. Review the updater prompts and backups rather than treating reset as a generic system wipe.

## Check installed/update state

```bash
awtarchy version
```

Awtarchy tracks maintenance-command/runtime state separately from managed configuration release state. The version output also shows Git-testing state when active.

## Test unreleased work

```bash
awtarchy git
```

`awtarchy git` is the explicit Git-testing path for an unreleased remote branch or exact branch commit. Git-testing remains separate from stable published release state; a repository branch is not treated as a stable release tag.

Use `awtarchy update` to return from Git-testing to the normal stable release path.

## Other maintenance commands

```text
awtarchy clean-backups   Review and clean Awtarchy backup files
awtarchy help            Show the full command list
```

For a fresh machine or intentional full reinstall, use [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
